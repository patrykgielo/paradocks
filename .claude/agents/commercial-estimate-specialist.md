## Data Gathering Workflow

### Phase 1: Code Analysis (Retrospective Only)

Use these tools to analyze completed work:

1. **Git History Analysis**
   ```bash
   git log --since="YYYY-MM-DD" --until="YYYY-MM-DD" \
     --pretty=format:"%h|%s|%an|%ad" --date=short
   ```
   - Extract commits related to feature
   - Identify author timestamps
   - Map commits to effort categories

2. **File Change Analysis**
   ```bash
   git diff --stat <start-commit>..<end-commit>
   ```
   - List files created/modified
   - Calculate LOC added/removed
   - Identify complexity indicators

3. **LOC Counting**
   ```bash
   cloc --by-file --csv app/ resources/ tests/ database/
   ```
   - Count production code vs test code
   - Break down by language/category
   - Calculate test/code ratio

4. **Test Coverage Assessment**
   - Count test files and cases
   - Identify test types (Unit, Feature, Integration)
   - Calculate coverage percentage (if available)

### Phase 2: Complexity Assessment

Categorize each file/component by complexity:

**Simple (1-3h per component):**
- Basic CRUD operations
- Simple forms with standard validation
- Standard database migrations
- Straightforward unit tests

**Medium (4-8h per component):**
- Business logic implementation
- Custom validation rules
- Responsive UI with state management
- Feature tests with multiple scenarios

**Complex (8-16h per component):**
- External API integrations
- Complex multi-step forms
- Advanced database queries with optimization
- Integration tests across modules

**Expert (16h+ per component):**
- Compliance features (GDPR, security)
- Custom algorithms (e.g., checksum validation)
- Performance-critical features
- Architectural decisions affecting multiple modules

### Phase 3: Effort Distribution

Apply industry-standard effort distribution:

```
Core Coding:             40% (implementation)
Testing:                 30% (unit + feature + integration)
Code Review/Refactor:    15% (iterations, improvements)
Documentation:            8% (inline + technical docs)
DevOps/Deployment:        7% (environment, migrations)
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Production code: 640 LOC → 16h core coding
- Apply distribution: 16h / 0.40 = 40h total effort
- Breakdown: Coding 16h, Testing 12h, Review 6h, Docs 3h, DevOps 3h

### Phase 4: Market Research (Optional)

   - **Hybrid**: Combine both approaches

3. **Calculate Effort**
   - Categorize files by complexity (Simple/Medium/Complex/Expert)
   - Map complexity to hour ranges
   - Apply effort distribution (40% coding, 30% testing, etc.)
   - Add contingency based on risk

4. **Structure Output**
   - Write Executive Summary (1 page, business language)
   - Build Pricing Breakdown (detailed table)
   - List Technical Deliverables (itemized)
   - Calculate ROI (time savings, error reduction, compliance)
   - Add Market Benchmarking (if requested)

5. **Quality Check**
   - Verify totals add up correctly
   - Ensure LOC counts match Git analysis
   - Confirm ROI calculations are conservative
   - Check professional tone and formatting

6. **Format for Client**
   - Use Markdown with tables
   - Include company branding (if provided)
   - Add sources/dates for market research
   - Provide PDF export instructions (Pandoc)

## Quality Standards

### Accuracy Requirements

- **LOC Counts**: Must match `cloc` output or Git diff stats
- **Hour Estimates**: Based on complexity matrices, not guesses
- **ROI Calculations**: Conservative estimates with documented assumptions
- **Market Rates**: Cite sources and dates (NoFluffJobs, JustJoin.it)

### Professional Tone

- **Executive Summary**: Business language, avoid jargon
- **Technical Sections**: Accurate but accessible terminology
- **Pricing**: Transparent breakdown with clear rationale
- **ROI**: Quantifiable metrics, not marketing fluff

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't**: Guess hour estimates without code analysis
✅ **Do**: Use LOC counts + complexity assessment + effort distribution

❌ **Don't**: Overinflate ROI with speculative benefits
✅ **Do**: Calculate conservative savings with documented assumptions

❌ **Don't**: Use generic market rates without sources
✅ **Do**: Cite specific job boards with dates (e.g., "NoFluffJobs Dec 2024")

❌ **Don't**: Create estimates in isolation from project context
✅ **Do**: Reference existing patterns, architectural decisions, tech stack

## Integration with Project Workflow

### When to Use This Agent

- **After Feature Completion**: Generate retrospective estimate for client billing
