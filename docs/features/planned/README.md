# Planned Features - Paradocks

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for future features that have been designed but not yet implemented.

## Purpose

These plans serve as:
- **Roadmap items** - Features ready for implementation when priorities align
- **Design documentation** - Research-backed decisions already made
- **Implementation guides** - Step-by-step execution plans with technical details
- **Knowledge preservation** - Valuable planning work saved for future use

## Status: Planned (Not Started)

### Visual Redesign v4.0 - Monochrome Color System

**Plan File:** [visual-redesign-v4.0-monochrome.md](./visual-redesign-v4.0-monochrome.md)

**Created:** 2025-12-11
**Status:** 🟡 **Planned** - Ready for implementation
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 8-9 hours (45 templates, 3 config files)

**Summary:**
Complete visual redesign implementing professional monochrome color palette with single turquoise accent. Addresses 6 critical improvements:

1. **Hero Section Mobile Fix** - Reduce height from 100vh to 50vh on mobile
2. **Gradient Removal** - Replace all purple/pink gradients with solid colors
3. **Border-Radius Standardization** - Unify to 10px across all UI elements
4. **Logo Preservation** - Keep sharp geometric edges as brand element
5. **Monochrome System** - 88% neutrals, 12% turquoise accent (#4AA5B0)
6. **Professional Quality** - Research-backed luxury brand aesthetic

**Key Decisions Made:**
- ✅ Color palette: "Medical Precision" monochrome (9 neutral shades + turquoise)
- ✅ Border-radius: 10px standard (0.625rem)
- ✅ Hero responsive: 50vh mobile → 70vh desktop
- ✅ Typography: Fluid with clamp() for optimal scaling
- ✅ No multi-color gradients (brand consistency)

**Technical Approach:**
- Phase 1: Design system foundation (30 min)
- Phase 2: Hero component fixes (45 min)
- Phase 3: Border-radius updates (2 hours)
- Phase 4: Page templates (2 hours)
- Phase 5: Gradient icon replacements (1 hour)
- Phase 6: CSS utilities (15 min)
- Phase 7: Testing & validation (1 hour)
- Phase 8: Documentation (30 min)

**Files to Modify:**
- `design-system.json` - Color palette v4.0.0
- `tailwind.config.js` - DaisyUI theme update
- `resources/css/app.css` - Fluid typography utilities
- 45+ Blade templates - Border-radius + gradient removal
- 10 core components - Hero, buttons, inputs, cards, etc.

**Dependencies:**
- None - can be implemented anytime
- Will require visual regression testing
- Should coordinate with any ongoing UI work

**When to Implement:**
Consider implementing when:
- Scheduling UI/UX improvements sprint
- Need to refresh brand identity
- Want to improve mobile experience
- Budget available for design polish (~1-2 dev days)

**References:**
- Research: BMW, Mercedes, Stripe, Linear design systems
- WCAG AA compliance maintained
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Design tokens: Single source of truth
